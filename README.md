- 👋 Hi, I’m @Antoinge, and it is my dream to be a developer. Obviously a dream is only that without the hard work so here I am working hard.
- 👀 Making games would be a greta career but its not for everyone. I do very much enjoy designing and writing software and i recently found i had a knack for requirement elicitation.
- 
- 🌱 My first ever project was a network mapping tool i developed as part of my final year of study. This was not good first outing and it is my intention to contnue working on this to make it work. I just cant bring myself to... yet. my current project is web scraper i am developing for a friend of mine. This is a better attempt because i have someone helping me spot mistakes and gaps in logic.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, anything really I dont have the expereince to be picky.
- 📫 How to reach me, I'm working up to this please be patient
